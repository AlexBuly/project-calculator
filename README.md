# project-calculator

In this project, I will be creating an on-screen calculator. The calculator will add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers. 

The operations will be created using functions for them that will be put into another function so that when "2+2" is entered, it will return the sum or when "2-2" is entered, it will return the difference.

The input for the calculator will be done using buttons. In addition to the operation buttons, there will be an equals button, buttons for the numbers 0-9, a clear button, a backspace button, and a decimal button. The number and decimals will be displayed on a screen above the calculator buttons singularly on the screen when clicked and will be stored so the calculator will remember the numbers when adding on more numbers. 

Only 3 variables will be used for the calculator. First number, the operator, and the second number. When clicking equals, the result will be returned. If the user clicks another operator instead, the result of those first 2 numbers will still be displayed but the additional operation(s) will be added on and stored with the old ones. The calculator will have a way to prevent it from crashing if the user tries to divide by 0.
